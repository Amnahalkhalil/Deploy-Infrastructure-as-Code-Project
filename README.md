# Deploy Infrastructure as Code Project
This repository contains the starter code for the final project of course 2 Infrastructure as Code in the Cloud DevOps Engineer Nanodegree.

# Project Introduction
Creating this project will give you the hands-on experience you need to talk about infrastructure as code confidently. We have chosen a realistic scenario where you will deploy a dummy application (a sample JavaScript or HTML file) to an NGINX server running on an EC2 instance.
There will be two parts to this project:

    Diagram: You'll first develop a diagram that you can present as part of your portfolio and as a visual aid to understand the CloudFormation script.
    Script (Template and Parameters): The second part is to interpret the instructions and create a matching CloudFormation script.
